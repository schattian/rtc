# Purpose

This subpkg is generates structs used to decode the JSON or `map[string]interface{}` formats of a **Commit to a struct** type (friendlier that managing commit changes or non-type safe bodies).

> Notice that _every generation needs a valid schema to be performed_.

An alternative to this could be using [gojson](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/gojson), creating the templates for every endpoint manually.
